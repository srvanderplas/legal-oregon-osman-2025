	abstract = {Data sharing is one of the cornerstones of modern science that enables large-scale analyses and reproducibility. We evaluated data availability in research articles across nine disciplines in Nature and Science magazines and recorded corresponding authors’ concerns, requests and reasons for declining data sharing. Although data sharing has improved in the last decade and particularly in recent years, data availability and willingness to share data still differ greatly among disciplines. We observed that statements of data availability upon (reasonable) request are inefficient and should not be allowed by journals. To improve data sharing at the time of manuscript acceptance, researchers should be better motivated to release their data with real benefits such as recognition, or bonus points in grant and job applications. We recommend that data management costs should be covered by funding agencies; publicly available research data ought to be included in the evaluation of applications; and surveillance of data sharing should be enforced by both academic publishers and funders. These cross-discipline survey data are available from the {plutoF} repository.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In order to evaluate the use of un-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) for detecting breast cancer, we evaluated the accuracy and the agreement of diffusion-weighted imaging ({DWI}) through the inter-reader reproducibility between expert and non-expert readers. Material and Methods: Consecutive breast {MRI} performed in a single centre were retrospectively evaluated by four radiologists with different levels of experience. The per-breast standard of reference was the histological diagnosis from needle biopsy or surgical excision, or at least one-year negative follow-up on imaging. The agreement across readers (by inter-reader reproducibility) was examined for each breast examined using Cohen’s and Fleiss’ kappa (κ) statistics. The Wald test was used to test the difference in inter-reader agreement between expert and non-expert readers. Results: Of 1131 examinations, according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 382 women were included (49.5 ± 12 years old), 40 of them with unilateral mastectomy, totaling 724 breasts. Overall inter-reader reproducibility was substantial (κ = 0.74) for expert readers and poor (κ = 0.37) for non- expert readers. Pairwise agreement between expert readers and non-expert readers was moderate (κ = 0.60) and showed a statistically superior agreement of the expert readers over the non-expert readers (p = 0.003). Conclusions: {DWI} showed substantial inter-reader reproducibility among expert-level readers. Pairwise comparison showed superior agreement of the expert readers over the non-expert readers, with the expert readers having higher inter-reader reproducibility than the non-expert readers. These findings open new perspectives for prospective studies investigating the actual role of {DWI} as a stand-alone method for un-enhanced breast {MRI}.},

So far, this problem has mainly been tackled in test–retest analyses. In this work we analyse radiomics feature reproducibility in two phases: first with manual segmentations provided by four expert readers and second with probabilistic automated segmentations using a recently developed neural network ({PHiseg}). We test feature reproducibility on three publicly available datasets of lung, kidney and liver lesions. We find consistent results both over manual and automated segmentations in all three datasets and show that there are subsets of radiomic features which are robust against segmentation variability and other radiomic features which are prone to poor reproducibility under differing segmentations. By providing a detailed analysis of robustness of the most common radiomics features across several datasets, we envision that more reliable and reproducible radiomic models can be built in the future based on this work.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: This retrospective cohort study included {FIGO} stage {IB}-{IVA} cervical cancer patients treated with chemoradiation between 2005 and 2014. There were three cohorts of women corresponding to each aim of the study: (1) 8 women who underwent test-retest {MRI}; (2) 20 women who underwent {MRI} on different scanners (diagnostic and simulation {MRI}); (3) 34 women whose diagnostic {MRIs} were contoured by three observers. Radiomic features based on first-order statistics, shape features and texture features were extracted from the original, Laplacian of Gaussian ({LoG})-filtered and wavelet-filtered images, for a total of 1761 features. Stability of radiomic features was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC}).
{RESULTS}: The inter-observer cohort had the most reproducible features (95.2\% with {ICC} ≥0.75) whereas the diagnostic-simulation cohort had the fewest (14.1\% with {ICC} ≥0.75). Overall, 229 features had {ICC} ≥0.75 in all three tests. Shape features emerged as the most stable features in all cohorts.
{CONCLUSION}: The diagnostic-simulation test resulted in the fewest reproducible features. Further research in {MRI}-based radiomics is required to validate the use of reproducible features in prognostic models.},

Death rates increased with amount of cigarette smoking and degree of inhalation. 3) Death rates from the following diseases were much higher in cigarette smokers than in nonsmokers: cancer of the lung, buccal cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, bladder, and pancreas; gastric ulcer; emphysema; and aortic aneurysm. Coronary artery disease death rates were highly related to cigarette smoking among men in the middle-age groups but less highly related among men in the old-age groups. In age group 40–59, the coronary artery disease death rate was 1.95 times as high among light cigarette smokers as among nonsmokers and 3.00 times as high among heavy cigarette smokers as among nonsmokers. 4) Death rates of cigarette smokers and nonsmokers were studied in relation to many other factors, such as longevity of parents and grandparents, cancer in parents and siblings, height, exercise, sleep, race, religion, education, marital status, nervous tension, and prior history of certain diseases. Within every group studied, the death rate of men who smoked 20 or more cigarettes a day was considerably higher than that of nonsmokers. 5) Nonsmokers were matched individually with men who smoked 20 or more cigarettes per day, the 2 men in each matched pair being similar in age, height, race, nativity, religion, marital status, residence (urban or rural), certain occupational exposures, education, drinking habits, nervous tension, use of tranquilizers, sleep, exercise, health at time of enrollment, and past history of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure. Altogether 36,975 such pairs were found. During the study, 1,385 of the 36,975 cigarette smokers died, while only 662 of the nonsmokers died. Of the cigarette smokers, 110 died with lung cancer and 654 with coronary artery disease, while, of the nonsmokers, 12 died with lung cancer and 304 with coronary artery disease. Emphysema caused the death of 15 cigarette smokers but only 2 nonsmokers. 6) The proportion of men hospitalized during the first 2 years of the study was considerably higher among cigarette smokers than among nonsmokers and increased with amount of cigarette smoking and degree of inhalation.},

Among 246 corresponding monozygotic male pairs, the numbers were 18 vs 18. For women, the numbers were 42 vs 31 among 781 dizygotic pairs, and 14 vs 13 among 326 monozygotic pairs. The hypermortality was mainly due to coronary heart disease, lung cancer, suicides, and accidents. Nonsmokers were registered at 10\% in a nationwide “alcohol registry” as against 30\% for high smokers. The mortality among the registered subjects was significantly higher than among the nonregistered, regardless of smoking. Data imply that part of the hypermortality among smokers is not due to smoking per se, but to factors associated with smoking.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in microscopy have made it possible to collect 3D topographic data, enabling more precise virtual comparisons based on the collected 3D data as a supplement to traditional comparison microscopy and 2D photography. Automatic comparison algorithms have been introduced for various scenarios, such as matching cartridge cases [1], [2] or matching bullet striae [3], [4], [5]. One key aspect of validating these automatic comparison algorithms is to evaluate the performance of the algorithm on external tests, that is, using data which were not used to train the algorithm. Here, we present a discussion of the performance of the matching algorithm [6] in three studies conducted using different Ruger weapons. We consider the performance of three scoring measures: random forest score, cross correlation, and consecutive matching striae ({CMS}) at the land-to-land level and, using Sequential Average Maxima scores, also at the bullet-to bullet level. Cross correlation and random forest scores both result in perfect discrimination of same-source and different-source bullets. At the land-to-land level, discrimination for both cross correlation and random forest scores (based on area under the curve, {AUC}) is excellent (≥ 0.90).},

Here, we investigate the applicability of the Chumbley method (J Forensic Sci, 2018, 63, 849; J Forensic Sci, 2010, 55, 953) (10,12), developed for screwdriver markings, for same-source identification of striations on bullet {LEAs}. The Hamby datasets 44 and 252 measured by {NIST} and {CSAFE} (high-resolution scans) are used here. We provide methods to identify parameters that minimize error rates for matching of {LEAs}, and a remedial algorithm to alleviate the problem of failed tests, while increasing the power of the test and reducing error rates. For 85,491 land-to-land comparisons (84,235 known nonmatches and 1256 known matches), the adapted test does not provide a result in 176 situations (originally more than 500). The Type I and Type {II} error rates are 7.2\% (6105 out of 84,235) and 21.4\% (271 out of 1256), respectively. This puts the proposed method on similar footing as other single-feature matching approaches in the literature.},

	abstract = {Scientific research is driven by our ability to use methods, procedures, and materials from previous studies and further research by adding to it. As the need for computationally-intensive methods to analyze large amounts of data grows, the criteria needed to achieve reproducibility, specifically computational reproducibility, have become more sophisticated. In general, prosaic descriptions of algorithms are not detailed or precise enough to ensure complete reproducibility of a method. Results may be sensitive to conditions not commonly specified in written-word descriptions such as implicit parameter settings or the programming language used. To achieve true computational reproducibility, it is necessary to provide all intermediate data and code used to produce published results. In this paper, we consider a class of algorithms developed to perform firearm evidence identification on cartridge case evidence known as the *Congruent Matching Cells* ({CMC}) methods. To date, these algorithms have been published as textual descriptions only. We introduce the first open-source implementation of the Congruent Matching Cells methods in the R package {cmcR}. We have structured the {cmcR} package as a set of sequential, modularized functions intended to ease the process of parameter experimentation. We use {cmcR} and a novel variance ratio statistic to explore the {CMC} methodology and demonstrate how to fill in the gaps when provided with computationally ambiguous descriptions of algorithms.},

  abstract = {Reviews conducted by the National Academy of Sciences (2009) and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (2016) concluded that the field of forensic firearm comparisons has not been demonstrated to be scientifically valid. Scientific validity requires adequately designed studies of firearm examiner performance in terms of accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility. Researchers have performed ``black-box'' studies with the goal of estimating these performance measures. As statisticians with expertise in experimental design, we conducted a literature search of such studies to date and then evaluated the design and statistical analysis methods used in each study. Our conclusion is that all studies in our literature search have methodological flaws that are so grave that they render the studies invalid, that is, incapable of establishing scientific validity of the field of firearms examination. Notably, error rates among firearms examiners, both collectively and individually, remain unknown. Therefore, statements about the common origin of bullets or cartridge cases that are based on examination of ``individual" characteristics do not have a scientific basis. We provide some recommendations for the design and analysis of future studies.},

Tests were performed as follows: First test correlated test-fires of the same type, second test compared different types of ammunition components, third test replicated the second test in a larger database, and fourth test replicated the third test with students having no previous firearm identification experience. System effectiveness with projectiles in the first test was 0.89. With cartridge cases, effectiveness was 0.79 with combined results, but analysis of separate results by breech face and firing pin revealed low effectiveness by breech face (0.40). In the second, third, and fourth tests, effectiveness with projectiles were 0.61, 0.51, and 0.44. In addition, these tests had effectiveness with cartridge cases equivalent to 0.55, 0.43, and 0.44.

	abstract = {Forensic testimony plays a crucial role in many criminal cases, with requests to crime laboratories steadily increasing. As part of efforts to improve the reliability of forensic evidence, scientific and policy groups increasingly recommend routine and blind proficiency tests of practitioners. What is not known is how doing so affects how lay jurors assess testimony by forensic practitioners in court. In Study 1, we recruited 1398 lay participants, recruited online using Qualtrics to create a sample representative of the U.S. population with respect to age, gender, income, race/ethnicity, and geographic region. Each read a mock criminal trial transcript in which a forensic examiner presented the central evidence. The low-proficiency forensic examiner elicited a lower conviction rate and less favorable impressions than the control, an examiner for which no proficiency information was disclosed. However, the high-proficiency examiner did not correspondingly elicit a higher conviction rate or more favorable impressions than the control. In Study 2, 1420 participants, similarly recruited using Qualtrics, received the same testimony, but for some conditions the examiner was cross-examined by a defense attorney. We find cross-examination significantly reduced guilty votes and examiner ratings for low-proficiency examiners. These results suggest that disclosing results of blind proficiency testing can inform jury decision-making, and further, that defense lawyering can make proficiency information particularly salient at a criminal trial.},

This experiment examined the way that people recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (n ϭ 541) responded to 2 types of forensic evidence—a {DNA} comparison and a shoeprint comparison—when an expert explained the strength of this evidence 3 different ways: using random match probabilities ({RMPs}), likelihood ratios ({LRs}), or verbal equivalents of likelihood ratios ({VEs}). We found that verdicts were sensitive to the strength of {DNA} evidence regardless of how the expert explained it, but verdicts were sensitive to the strength of shoeprint evidence only when the expert used {RMPs}. The weight given to {DNA} evidence was consistent with the predictions of a Bayesian network model that incorporated the perceived risk of a false match from 3 causes (coincidence, a laboratory error, and a frame-up), but shoeprint evidence was undervalued relative to the same Bayesian model. Fallacious interpretations of the expert’s testimony (consistent with the source probability error and the defense attorney’s fallacy) were common and were associated with the weight given to the evidence and verdicts. The findings indicate that perceptions of forensic science evidence are shaped by prior beliefs and expectations as well as expert testimony and consequently that the best way to characterize and explain forensic evidence may vary across forensic disciplines.},

Highly numerate individuals appear to pay more attention to numbers, better comprehend them, translate them into meaningful information, and ultimately use them in decisions. Decisions of the less numerate are informed less by numbers and more by other non-numeric sources of information, such as their emotions, mood states, and trust or distrust in science, the government, and experts. Careful attention to information presentation, however, allows the less numerate to understand and use numbers more effectively in decisions. As a result, the challenge is not merely to communicate accurate information to the public but to understand how to present that information so that it is used in risky decisions.},

The presence of opposing expert testimony caused jurors to be skeptical of all expert testimony rather than sensitizing them to ﬂaws in the other expert’s testimony. Jurors rendered more guilty verdicts when they heard opposing expert testimony than when opposing expert testimony was absent, regardless of whether the opposing testimony addressed the methodology of the original expert or the validity of the original expert’s testimony. Thus, contrary to the assumptions in the Supreme Court’s decision in Daubert, opposing expert testimony may not be an effective safeguard against junk science in the courtroom.},
