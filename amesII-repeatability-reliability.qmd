The Ames II study is one of the few studies conducted using an open-set design in which each comparison consists of fired ammunition from one known firearm and one unknown firearm^[1]; this design is essential to ensure that it is possible to calculate the total number of comparisons performed by each examiner.

^[1]: Many studies provide multiple exemplars from the same firearm in order to allow examiners to determine how consistently the firearm produces 'individual characteristics' (to use the term as it is defined by examiners). As long as there are exemplars from at most two firearms, it is still possible to estimate the number of firearm-to-firearm comparisons performed. 

While there are a significant number of flaws with the Ames II study [See @cuellarMethodologicalProblemsEvery2024, which is also under review in Law, Probability, and Risk], it is the only study currently available which allows researchers to assess the repeatability and reliability of firearms and toolmark examination as a discipline. 
Unfortunately, the data analysis in the original paper is incredibly flawed: the paper compares the measured repeatability to the expected repeatability without consideration for the ordered nature of the variables; additional flaws are described in @dorfmanReAnalysisRepeatabilityReproducibility2022.
